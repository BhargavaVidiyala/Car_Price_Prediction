We import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
We load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
We check for missing values in the dataset.
We visualize the distribution of car prices and the correlation between features using plots.
We define the target variable and features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
We create and train a decision tree regressor model.
We make predictions on the test set and compute the mean absolute error to evaluate model performance.
Finally, we print the mean absolute error and the score of the model on the test set.
